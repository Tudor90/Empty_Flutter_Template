# empty_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# Part 1 - Let's make an application!

Build an application that fetches data from this API - [https://randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) - and displays 2 lists of Users. 
Start by reading the API documentation [https://randomuser.me/documentation](https://randomuser.me/documentation). Your application shouldÂ fetch 15 users per list from that API and display them in the same screen with the following requirements: one list that displays female users and has a horizontal scrolling, and one below that displays male users and has a vertical scrolling.
